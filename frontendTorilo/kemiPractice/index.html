 "I initially assumed that this fake gossip fabricated with such malicious intent would not be taken seriously. However in the last 24h I've been reminded that we live in a society that is so quick to speak on topics regardless of factual basis and that nothing is off limits.
 
 "Not even during what should be one of the most beautiful and celebrated times in one's life. 
 
  "Therefore I have to speak up as this is not only directed towards me but it is related to people I have a great amount of respect and affection for. While Rih is continuing to live her serene, best dressed pregnancy life and I go back to my business â€” I wish everyone a beautiful Easter weekend!"<i><br>
